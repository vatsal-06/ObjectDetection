# ObjectDetection
AI Capstone Project K.R. Mangalam World School, G.K. - II (2023-24)

Introduction:
Object Detection uses the power of Python & Computer Vision to
detect objects in a sample video or real-time footage from a camera.
The CV model divides the input video into frames and further
simplifies these frames into content viewable by the contours and
draws contours around the detected object.
Aim: We aim to show a preview of how this technology can be used
further in various sectors (as mentioned in logbook) by further
enhancements.

Description:
• The Project opens up with a window showing options to detect
motion either from a video, webcam or external camera
• The basic idea of the project is to detect movement by drawing
out boxes around objects in movement using pre-defined
algorithms of OpenCV
• The Video option can be used for motion detection on a given
video. The video is broken down into individual frames and then
motion is detected using contouring.
• The Face Detection option accesses your devices camera and is
calibrated while testing to even detect slight facial movements,
which can be used in investigations, security, etc.
• The final webcam option uses any camera provided while
coding to detect motion. It can be used as application in CCTV
cameras at best.
